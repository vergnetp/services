* stateful services health checks need to be checked by tcp ping rather than http -> todo
* we refactored all so that droplets don't have any direct access: need either to send http requests to limited endpoints offered by node agent (port 9999 - require a key that is hash of do client) or to port 80/433 for our client's webservices 
* only ssh allowed during base snapshot creation (need ssh to install node agent)

* custom snapshots are created via node agent (to send/build image) - user can then chose the snapshot (e.g. "my-llm-ready-snapshot") and do "from local/base:latest" in docker file (imag always named "base")
* REQUIRE_AUTH_ALWAYS set to true by default to force node_agent to require api key even when traffic comes from VPC
