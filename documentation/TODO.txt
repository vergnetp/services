# Deploy API - TODO & Known Issues

## ✅ COMPLETED

4. Backend logs for admin - DONE (2026-01-20)
   - Added /api/v1/admin/logs endpoint
   - Telemetry tab in frontend shows logs when admin

## 🔧 IN PROGRESS / TO TEST

1. UI errors (to test):
   - TypeError: He.post is not a function (Dockerfile generation)
   - 404 on deploy-configs endpoint

3. Domain latency:
   - What should user expect for new domain availability?
   - Consider auto-checking domain ready status
   - Subdomain naming: uses "default" instead of project name

## 📋 BACKLOG

2. UI improvements:
   - [x] Clear service name/project/env when switching deployment types
   - [x] Reset new server count after deploy
   - [x] Container list in server boxes (need to fix logs)
   - [x] Available snapshot loading in background
   - [ ] Deploy tab redesign (per ChatGPT mockup)

5. Fix ai_agents_api

6. DNS cleanup safety:
   - CRITICAL: Code deleted A records that were not proxied - BIG NO
   - Need to add safety check before DNS record deletion

## 🚀 FUTURE

- Auto-scaling
- Docker image cleanup on servers
- Migration scripts (when leaving dev phase)
