 -> to test

2. Ui improvements:
* should clear service name /project/env when switching from stateful to service etc -> validated
* should put new server to zero after hitting deploy (so as not to provision by mistake later) -> validated
* we used to show the containers (and some quick action icons) in the server box in the infrastructure tab. bring it back! -> validated but need to fix log
* deploy tab is overwhelming: Change as per chatgpt mockup
* Available snapshot is not fired in teh background like other data (servers etc) -> validated

3.  domain slow to work
What should teh user expect in term of latency to be able to use his new domain? Maybe we should either give a heads up or even automat ethe domain ready status for him?
once available, then re-deploy are immediate, right?
c62610-default-prod-deploy-api is the subdomain (why default? should have been my project name - "Deployer")
 -> to test

4. should show the backend log if admin

5. Fix ai_agents_api

6. code deleted A record that were not proxied -> BIG NO
